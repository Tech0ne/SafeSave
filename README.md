# SafeSave
Locally save data using millitary-grade encryption (yes, like Overpass, but mine works ;) )

---

## How it works

Save RSA private key on a USB stick, crypted using AES with a user chosen password

## How to use

If you are on windows, just install Python 3.XX, and run

If you have another OS, install packages `python3` and `python3-pip` (using apt-get, dnf...) and run

## How to run

If you are on windows, just double-click

If you have another OS, open a terminal and run `python3 install_safe_save.py`
